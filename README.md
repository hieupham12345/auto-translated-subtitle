# 🌍 Auto Translated Subtitle  

Turn any video into translated subtitles with ease.  
This project is designed to be simple yet powerful — powered entirely by the **ChatGPT API**.  

## 🔄 Pipeline  
🎥 **Video** → 📝 **SRT (via OpenAI Whisper)** → 🤖 **Translated SRT (via ChatGPT API)**  

## ✨ Features  
- 🌐 **Subtitle Translation**: Translate `.srt` subtitle files into your target language using the **ChatGPT API**.  
- ⏱️ **Accurate Timestamp Preservation**: Only text is translated — timestamps remain perfectly aligned.  
- 🎬 **Long Video Support**: Handle extremely long subtitle files without breaking.  
- 🗂️ **Batch Processing**: Drop multiple `.srt` files into the input folder and translate them all at once.  
- ⚡ **Multi-threading**: Speed up processing with configurable threading.  

## 🚀 Usage  
Super easy to use — the project comes with a single `.ipynb` notebook.  
The notebook is **well-documented and step-by-step annotated**, so you can just run it directly without confusion.  

⚠️ **Important:**  
Add your **OpenAI ChatGPT API key** before running the notebook.
